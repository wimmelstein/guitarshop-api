# Jack's Guitar Shop

I have taken the liberty of providing a git repository that will accompany the lessons.
Each lesson has one or more branches. The master branch will be bare bones, and should never be merged.

To check out each branch, do e.g.:

```git checkout lesson1/my-first-api```

Branches currently available:

lesson1/my-first-api

***Do not push to this repository***
