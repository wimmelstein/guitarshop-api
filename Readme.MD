# Jack's Guitar Shop

I have taken the liberty of providing a git repository that will accompany the lessons.
Each lesson has one or more branches. The master branch will be bare bones, and should never be merged.

To check out each branch, do e.g.:

```git checkout lesson1/my-first-api```

Branches currently available:

* lesson1/my-first-api
* lesson3/spring-data
* lesson4/tips-and-tricks
* lesson4/derby
* lesson4/tips-and-tricks
* lesson5/security-base (temporary branch)
* lesson5/security-api-key
* lesson5/security-users
* lesson5/users-with-login-page (in memory authentication)

* generic/deploy-to-tomcat (out of scope for exam)

For API Testing also the following branches are available:

* api-testing/lesson1
* api-testing/lesson2
